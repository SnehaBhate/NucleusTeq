In Java, there are several InputStream and OutputStream classes available to deal with files. Here are some commonly used classes:

1.	FileInputStream: This class is used to read data from a file as bytes. It provides an InputStream that reads bytes from a file.
2.	FileOutputStream: This class is used to write data to a file as bytes. It provides an OutputStream that writes bytes to a file.
3.	BufferedInputStream: This class provides buffering for an input stream. It reads data from an input stream and stores it in an internal buffer.
4.	BufferedOutputStream: This class provides buffering for an output stream. It writes data to an output stream and stores it in an internal buffer.
5.	DataInputStream: This class is used to read primitive data types from an input stream. It provides methods to read different types of data such as integers, floats, and doubles.
6.	DataOutputStream: This class is used to write primitive data types to an output stream. It provides methods to write different types of data such as integers, floats, and doubles.
7.	ObjectInputStream: This class is used to read objects from an input stream. It can be used to read objects that have been serialized.
8.	ObjectOutputStream: This class is used to write objects to an output stream. It can be used to serialize objects and write them to a file.
These classes can be used to read and write data to files in various formats.
